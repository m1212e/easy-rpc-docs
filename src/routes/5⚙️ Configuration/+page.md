# Configuration
To configure easy-rpc you can adjust two files. The `erpc.json` inside a project directory or a `roles.json` inside a source directory.

> If you are unfamiliar with the project structure of an easy-rpc setup, see the **[setup guide in the getting started section](/easy-rpc-docs/2üõ†Ô∏è%20Getting%20started/1Setup)**

## erpc.json
The `erpc.json` tells the transpiler that the current directory is a project directory for a role. It defines the used role with a `"role"` property. This string must match one of the roles configured in the used sources. The `"sources"` property is an array of source directories which should be used. The path can be relative to the `erpc.json` or absolute.

<Code filename="erpc.json">

```json
{
    "sources": ["../sources"],
    "role": "Backend"
}

```

</Code>

## roles.json
The `roles.json` lives inside a source directory and specifies which roles are available to declare endpoints on. 

<Code filename="roles.json">

```json
[
	{
		"name": "Frontend",
		"type": "browser",
		"documentation": "This is a frontend client"
	},
	{
		"name": "Backend",
		"type": "http-server"
	}
]

```

</Code>

Each role has a `name` which it can be referred as and a `type` array which specifies of what kind the role is. Available values for the `type` attribute are

| Value       | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| http-server | A server serving http requests         |
| browser     | A webbrowser                           |

The optional documentation can be used to provide more info on a role and what it does.
